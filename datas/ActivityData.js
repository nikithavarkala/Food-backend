Only difference is yours doesn't have bay leaves, which is fine with me since you're not supposed to eat them anyway. Because I used (2) 1-lb pkgs of meatloaf mix (beef, pork and veal blend) I got on sale today, I increased the other ingredients a bit, except the tomato sauce. It smells yummy, so I'm writing this review to give it a chance to rest before I dig in. lol Also, I don't know if changing the meat mixture helped, but this is the FIRST meatloaf I've ever made in my 40+ yrs of cooking that DIDN'T SHRINK AT ALL!!

We usually just slice it up dust it with flour and fry it in a little butter. I want to try something new. I would like to still dust it with a little flour but bake it until it becomes nice and crispy and then use it like a bread and put a fried egg in between with maybe a sausage patty or bacon and make like a breakfast sandwich out of it. My question is to anyone who may have tried it or may just have an idea. Do you think this would work and do you think it would taste good? I love doing crazy dishes like omelets made with leftover pasta and I just thought this would taste good. Instead of using English muffins I would like to use crispy baked mush. So anyone who has an idea please throw it out there. Thank you."

        review:"Subbed butter for oil Added unsweetened coconut flakes 2/3 cup Added 1 cup walnuts 2 tsp cinnamon into dry mix Generous dash cardamom Small pinch of ground cloves A dash of nutmeg Used a total of 5 large ripe bananas I used a muffin tin (brushed with butter and dusted with flour for easy release) and an 8x11 glass baking dish brushed with butter. Best banana bread I've ever made, even my nut and fruit-hating kid loves it!"

        review:"I made a list of small changes and it turned out amazing!! So instead of frozen spinach I sautéed 6oz of fresh spinach, seasoned with salt pepper onion power and garlic powder, used white basmati rice instead of brown, and instead of cream of chicken or celery I used cream of broccoli. Also I didn't bake it just kept it on a low to medium heat after mixing everything together for 5-10 mins",
